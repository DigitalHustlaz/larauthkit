Laravel Keycloak SSO Integration

Drop-in single-sign-on solution for Laravel projects.

## Purpose

Provide a low-impact way to integrate new and existing Laravel projects with a
single-sign-on solution providing a universal identity across all products in
the ecosystem.

Note that this currently only integrates with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).
It should be trivial to extend to any other provider that's supported by Laravel's
Socialite package or its plugins.

## Features

* Drop-in, almost zero-config solution.
* Integrates with existing Laravel user and authentication systems.

## Setup

For brand new projects. See [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

## Migrating

For existing projects. See [MIGRATING.md](docs/MIGRATING.md).

## Usage

What it looks like once you've completed setup/migration as well as some
information on available events as well as some useful customizations.

See [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).
